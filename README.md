# BibleMadLibs
Bible Ad-Libs, or "God-Libs," is a work-in-progress Madlibs-style game that pulls randomly generated Bible passages from Bible.org, then turns 10 random words into blanks for the user to fill in using [Madlibify](https://github.com/rockbot/madlibify). When finished, a stone tablet emerges from the bottom of the screen with your ad-libbed story. There's also a "classic" button so you can read the original scripture and options to share stories with your friends!
